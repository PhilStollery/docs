# Introduction to Cloud-native service to service communication patterns

[!INCLUDE [download-alert](../includes/download-alert.md)]

In this chapter, we will discuss cloud-native communication patterns. Initially we will discover how front-end clients communicate with back-end microservices, before talking about API Gateway platforms and real-time communication. We will then look at how microservices communicate with other back-end services and we will look at both synchronous HTTP communication and asynchronous messaging across services. We will cover gRPC, an upcoming technology in the cloud-native world. Finally, we will introduce a new and rapidly evolving technology entitled Service Mesh that can streamline microservice communication.
